(ideas)
    add jesus to game as competing shop with zach
    #pacman explains the competition situation in scene5
    get pacman as an item that lets you fly up to certain areas (spider boss)
    winrar instantly beats the game
    maybe sell malcolm to zach to get some extra money that could help u later
    John gonna voice pacman
    lice npc/item
    two seprate currencies for zach and jesus shop
    jesus ONLY accepts lice as payment
    Jesus sells counterfeit money you can use in zach's store
    #jesus sells used condoms
    #jesus sells NBA 2k19 or something like that
    "are you with the feds?"
    player decides which shop to help (implement this in late game)
